# Substrate mechanics modulate peptide phosphorylation and inferred kinase activity in LMNA mutant fibroblasts


## Abstract

Cells convert physical cues into biochemical signals via mechanosensitive pathways, primarily using reversible protein phosphorylation as a regulatory switch. Cardiolaminopathy caused by *LMNA* gene variants is an example of a disease with disrupted mechanosensing. Despite that, cardiolaminopathy *in vitro* modelling is still predominantly performed using rigid supraphysiological plastic and glass substrates that poorly mimic physical properties of native tissue. Therefore, we investigated how different substrates and mechanical culture conditions, here jointly referred to as substrate mechanics, regulate mechanosensitive protein phosphorylation. We profiled serine/threonine kinase (STK) activity of control and cardiolaminopathic human fibroblasts cultured across a gradient of conditions from rigid-unstrained to soft-unstrained towards an added stretch defined as soft-strained. The cardiolaminopathy line carrying the LMNA p.R377L variant serves as an example of impaired mechanosensing. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the same cell lines but varying culture conditions demonstrated that substrate mechanics was the dominant factor of variability. Following the gradient from rigid-unstrained to soft-unstrained to soft-strained conditions, we show an increase in phosphopeptide (pPs) intensity levels, improved replicate consistency, and increased inferred STK activity. We identified 20 phosphopeptides related to fibroblast expressed proteins that are substrate mechanics-responsive across the tested conditions. Furthermore, the dominant driver of differential mechanosensitive activity was identified on plastic (rigid-unstrained) versus silicone (soft-unstrained) cultureware switch with 89 STKs identified as unique mechanosensitive targets. This proof-of-concept mechanobiology study concludes that substrate mechanics is a dominant driver of phosphoproteomic signalling variability in human dermal fibroblasts.

## Analysis Overview

### [`pPs_analysis_script.R`](/scripts/pPs_analysis_script.R/)

This script performs the following steps:

1. **Data loading & merging** - Loads raw kinome array data from four Excel files (Runs 1–2, 3–4, and 5–6 for LMNA and WT) and merges them into a single matrix, retaining phosphopeptides present in ≥90% of samples.
2. **Heatmap** - Generates a z-score-scaled hierarchical clustering heatmap using `ComplexHeatmap`, annotated by substrate mechanics, genotype, and run ID.
3. **PCA** - Performs principal component analysis on the phosphopeptide matrix (missing values imputed with column means). Produces plots for:
   - Overall genotype separation (_PC1 vs PC2_)
   - Substrate mechanics separation (_PC1 vs PC2_)
   - Batch effects (_PC2 vs PC3_)
   - Variance explained bar chart (top 10 PCs)
   - Per-substrate genotype comparisons (Rigid-unstrained, Soft-unstrained, Soft-strained)
4. **Dot plots** - Visualises individual pPs expression per condition with t-tests (BH-corrected). pPs are ranked by significance; the top 25 most significant are plotted by default.
5. **LMM** - Calculation and visualisation of linear mixed-effect model

### [`UKA_heatmap_scripts.R`](/scripts/UKA_heatmap_scripts.R/)

This script performs the following steps:

1. **Substrate mechanics comparison** - Loads UKA output CSVs comparing Hard vs Soft and Stretch vs Soft conditions, filters by contrast group, and generates a heatmap of mean kinase statistic scores (thresholded by median final score > 1.2) across substrate mechanics conditions for both genotypes.
2. **Genotype comparison** - Loads UKA output CSVs comparing hfLMNA<sup>R377L/WT</sup> vs hfLMNA<sup>WT/WT</sup> per substrate condition (Rigid-unstrained, Soft-unstrained, Soft-strained) and generates a corresponding kinase activity heatmap.

### [`PamDx_GTExanalysis.Rmd`](/scripts/PamDx_GTExanalysis.Rmd/)

This script visualizes pPs expression in different celltype, based on publicly available RNAseq datasets
